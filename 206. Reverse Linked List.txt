1.Initialize three pointers prev as NULL, curr as head and next as NULL.
2.Iterate through the linked list. In loop, do following. 
	// Before changing next of current, 
	// store next node 
	next = curr->next
	// Now change next of current 
	// This is where actual reversing happens 
	curr->next = prev 
	// Move prev and curr one step forward 
	prev = curr 
	curr = next

ListNode* reverseList(ListNode* head) {
        ListNode* pre=NULL;
        ListNode* next=NULL;
        while(head!=NULL){
            next=head->next;
            head->next=pre;
            pre=head;
            head=next;
        }
        return pre;
}


Recursive Method: 

   1) Divide the list in two parts - first node and 
      rest of the linked list.
   2) Call reverse for the rest of the linked list.
   3) Link rest to first.
   4) Fix head pointer
